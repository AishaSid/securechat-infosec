Subject: Assignment A02 — Implementation Report

Purpose
I submit this report describing the implementation and testing I performed for Assignment A02. The project implements a secure chat demonstration using certificate-based authentication, ephemeral X25519 key agreement, AES-GCM for authenticated encryption, and an append-only transcript store with offline verification.

Implementation Summary
- Cryptography: RSA for long-term signing keys and X.509 certificates; X25519 for ephemeral ECDH; HKDF-SHA256 to derive symmetric keys; AES-GCM for AEAD messaging.
- Key components implemented or completed:
  - `app/crypto/`: PKI helpers, RSA sign/verify, X25519 key agreement, AES-GCM encryption helpers.
  - `app/server.py` and `app/client.py`: interactive server and client that exchange certificates, perform ECDH, derive AES keys, sign messages, and record transcripts.
  - `storage/transcript.py`: SQLite-backed transcript store and verification utilities.
  - `scripts/`: utilities to run the demo (`run_demo.py`), list and verify transcripts (`show_transcripts.py`), export transcripts to JSON (`export_transcripts.py`), and perform tamper testing (`tamper_transcript.py`, `tamper_debug.py`).

Evidence Produced
- `transcripts.db`: SQLite database containing recorded messages, certificates, ciphertexts, nonces, and signatures for each message exchange.
- `exports/`: JSON exports of transcript entries for offline inspection and submission.
- Tamper testing scripts and outputs demonstrating verification behavior.

Limitations and Notes
- The transcript store currently retains plaintext alongside ciphertext for convenient verification and grading; this is noted in the documentation and can be changed to store only ciphertext and a message hash for privacy if required.
- Replay detection and a formally signed SessionReceipt generator are planned next steps and are listed in the project TODO.

Execution (concise)
- To run a demo session (one-shot server+client in-process):
  - `python .\scripts\run_demo.py`
- To run the server and client interactively in separate terminals:
  - `python -m app.server`
  - `python -m app.client`
- To list or verify transcripts:
  - `python .\scripts\show_transcripts.py`
- To export transcripts for offline submission:
  - `python .\scripts\export_transcripts.py --all --out exports --db transcripts.db`

Conclusion
The implementation demonstrates certificate-based authentication, ephemeral key agreement, authenticated encryption, and tamper-evident transcript storage with verification. Test scripts and exported evidence accompany this submission for grading.
